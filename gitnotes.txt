Git is a version control tool, free and open source to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

Git is a client that we can install on the system while github is a remote repository where you can store the code, applications, projects etc.

 In CentOS 07
**************
#yum install git

#mkdir demo
#cd demo
#git init		(initialize local repository)

++After initializing the local repository .git hidden folder is created.

#mkdir test	(create on /root/Desktop)
#git init
# touch file1 file2
#git add <filename>	(add file into Staging Area)
#git add file1

#git add file1 file2		(for multiple files)

#git status		(check the status if a file has been added into the staging area or not)

#touch file{3..10}

#git add .		OR	#git add -A	(to add all the files into the staging area)	(. means current directory but -A flag will add all files from the current as well as its subdirectory in staging area.) 

#git commit -m "optional comment"	-m	(for message)

#git config - - global user.email "susgao789@gmail.com"

#git clone <paste the linkof remote repo to clone>
